To get started, download and install Insomnia from the provided link. Once installed, you can import the endpoint collection from the [Insomnia_byte_bistro_api.json](Insomnia_byte_bistro_api.json) file. This file contains pre-configured requests for all the API endpoints and can be used to quickly test and interact with the API.
